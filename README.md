Running the Command
Once everything is set up, you can build and run the CLI tool:

Build the project:

```sh
go build -o json-cli
```
Run the process command:

```sh

./json-cli process input.json output_directory
```
Replace input.json with the path to your input JSON file and output_directory with the directory where you want the output to be saved.
